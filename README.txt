This repository is for the easy tracking and distribution of my *nix settings
dot files. Upon installing a new system, my methodology up to now has been to mv
or source from my Dropbox folder. There are pros and cons to that situation, but
I have decided that using a repository, hosted on a public website, has many
more benefits.

To begin with, the repository will be in an in-between state that does not
reflect its end (or ‘cruising’) condition. Eventually, all important dot files
will be contained herein, along with utility scripts for actualizing them into
the home folder (symlinking them upon first install, or when adding new files).

This is not a complete solution. I still consider Dropbox to be great for other
things that may be closely intertwined with this repository. For example,
‘~/Dropbox/Vim/GlobalRuntimePath/’ will still contain all my Vim plugins and
scripts (with the exception of my vimrc, eventually), notably including any that
will automatically actualize files herein to the home folder, as previously
mentioned. I may choose to source those in or link from here, though.
