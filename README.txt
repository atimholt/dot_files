This repository is for the easy tracking and distribution of my *nix settings
dot files. Upon installing a new system, my methodology up to now has been to mv
or source from my Dropbox folder. There are pros and cons to that situation, but
I have decided that using a repository, hosted on a public website, has many
more benefits.

All my important dot files are contained herein, along with a utility script
(make_links.sh) for actualizing them into the home folder (symlinking them upon
first install, or when adding new files).

This repository is not yet totally self-contained. For example,
~/Dropbox/Vim/GlobalRuntimePath/ still contains a couple files for making vim
work the way I want.

This repository’s main location is on bitbucket, but I’ll be keeping a parallel
version of it on github.
